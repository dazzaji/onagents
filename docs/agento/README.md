# Agento Codebase

Agento is the codename for the collection of LLM Agent design patterns and approaches I've worked on since April, 2024.  The code is totally modular and each module represents a core value-proposition capability of LLM-based agents, and has a standard (JSON) input and output.  That means you can use *any* agent framework (eg LangGraph, AutoGPT, AutoGen, etc, etc) for any module and the entire system works like a charm.  It also means multiple teams across business, legal, and network boundaries can seamlessly collaborate or team up in other ways to outperform what any of them could accomplish alone.  But that isn't even the coolest part.  This code is FIRE.  I'll share it here.
