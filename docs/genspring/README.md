# Autonomously Generating New Value

When patterned in particular ways, LLM agent systems can serve as wellsprings of new value.  By composing the right design patterns of agentic processes in the right sequences, it is possible to generate novel and independently valuable outputs.  This may be the most economically and societally important capability of these systems.  

This page will spotlight the GenSpring module of my [Agento codebase](https://onagents.org/agento), which demonstrates the capability of new value creation, as well as delve into the recent research and science behind this profound capacity of frontier generative AI models applied in very specific agentic design patterns.
