# Dazza Greenwood, On Agents

I'll be collecting and sharing my thoughts, and some new work, on LLM-based agents here at [OnAgents.org](https://onagents.org). 

This is very much a work in progras and I'll be adding content to this site for awhile.

Here is my tentative outline of major content categories:

1 [Background Materials](background/)

2 [Codename Agento](agento/)

3 [Agent Design Patterns](patterns/)

4 [Principal Agent User](principles/)

5 [Agent Transactions](transactions/)

6 [Springs of New Value](genspring/)
