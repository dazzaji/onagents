# Dazza Greenwood, On Agents

I'll be collecting and sharing my throughts, and some new work, on LLM-based agents here at [OnAgents.org](https://onagents.org).

This is very much a work in progras and I'll be adding content to this site for awhile.

Here is my tentative outline of major content categories:

1 [Background Materials](1_background/)

2 Agento Project

3 Agent Design Patterns

4 Core Identity and Ownership

5 Transactional Agents

6 New Value
