# Personal Background

This page is just to collect some of the relevant stuff I've done in the past (sometimes the *distant* past) related to agents.

Back in the late 1980's I wrote my first software agent as part of a computer science class project.  It was a Lisp re-implementation of the classic Eliza program.  We worked on Vax machine.  I found some bootleg games on the Vax and that led me to discover gateways from our network (which was part of the old Bitnet) to this new thing called the "Internet".  But that's another story.

I'll fill in the gaps from student project to modern times later.

Recently, I introduced the Wyoming legislature to the [emerging state of LLM agents as part of a hearing on algorithmic decision making](https://www.dazzagreenwood.com/p/testimony-on-agentic-ai-systems-and).  Here is that testimony, which concluded with a plan for me to put together and facilitate a more in-depth session on the topic at a future hearing.

And that subsequent hearing did happen, on Sept 16th, 2024.  You can enjoy the presentations and disusssion [here](https://www.dazzagreenwood.com/p/legislative-hearing-on-llm-agents). 

There was a talk I gave at the most recent Stanford CodeX LLM x Legal Hackathon on the topic of LLM Agents and the Law.
